# Flask Syncverse App

This is a Flask-based web application that provides user authentication (login and signup), a dashboard for model setup and downloads, and additional routes like profile and results. It also integrates with Ngrok to make the app accessible over a public URL.

- **User Authentication**: 
  - Login and signup functionality with secure password hashing.
- **Dashboard**: 
  - Accessible post-login for performing tasks like model setup.
- **Profile Page**: 
  - Displays user-specific information.
- **Result Page**: 
  - Placeholder for generated content or results.
- **Logout**: 
  - Clears session data and logs the user out.
- **Ngrok Integration**: 
  - Makes the app publicly accessible using Ngrok.

## Routes Overview

| Route           | Method | Description                                                                 |

## Ngrok Integration
To enable public access to the app:
1. [Sign up for Ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) and get your authentication token.
2. Replace the placeholder in `app.py` with your token:
   ```python
   ngrok.set_auth_token("Your_Auth_Token")
   ```

---

## Security Notes
- **Session Management**: A `secret_key` is used for managing sessions and flash messages. Replace the placeholder with a strong secret key.
- **Password Storage**: User passwords are hashed using `werkzeug.security` for secure storage.

---

## Known Issues
- Ensure GPU availability if using the model setup functionality.
- Verify that all necessary Python packages are installed.
